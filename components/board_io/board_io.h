/*
 * board_io.h — on-board sensors for the Waveshare ESP32-S3-RLCD-4.2.
 *
 * One shared I2C master bus (SDA=13, SCL=14) drives the SHTC3 temperature/
 * humidity sensor (0x70) and the PCF85063A RTC (0x51); the battery voltage is
 * read on ADC1 channel 3 (GPIO4) through the board's 1:3 divider.
 *
 * The RTC is kept in UTC: seed the system clock from it at boot (so the screen
 * shows the right time even before SNTP, and across brief power loss), and write
 * the SNTP-synced time back into it once online. Display code applies the local
 * timezone via the C library (TZ + localtime_r).
 *
 * Every getter is defensive: if a device is missing or NAKs, it returns
 * false / 0 instead of blocking the caller, so a depopulated sensor never
 * wedges the render loop.
