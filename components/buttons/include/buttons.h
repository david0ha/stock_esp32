/*
 * buttons.h — physical button input for the ESP32-S3-RLCD-4.2 board.
 *
 * Two press-to-GND buttons are exposed to the app as a FreeRTOS event queue:
 *
 *   USER (GPIO18) — a free-for-the-app button       -> BUTTON_USER
 *   BOOT (GPIO0)  — download-mode pin at reset, but a normal input afterwards
 *                                                    -> BUTTON_BOOT
 *
 * Both are active-low (internal pull-up + falling-edge interrupt) and debounced
 * in the ISR. A press posts one button_event_t to the caller-owned queue; the
 * app task decides what each button means (e.g. next ticker / next view).
